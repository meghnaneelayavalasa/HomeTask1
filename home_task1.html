                    Will Smith stormed the Oscars stage and struck comedian Chris Rock across the face for joking about his wife, 
                    in a moment at Sunday's gala that immediately went viral and left stunned viewers questioning if it had been 
                    scripted or genuine. Rock, presenting the best documentary prize with a short comedy routine, had cracked a joke comparing Jada 
                    Pinkett Smith's tightly cropped hair to Demi Moore's appearance in the film "G.I. Jane" and suggesting she appear in a sequel.
